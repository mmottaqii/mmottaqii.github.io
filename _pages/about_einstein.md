Welcome to my Personal Webpage

Hello! I am MohammadSadeq Mottaqi, a Biochemistry Ph.D. student in Prof. Lei Xie's lab quite fascinated with the applications of Deep Learning (DL) in the computational biology field. My research centers on developing DL models and integration of omics data (transcriptomic, scRNA-sequencing, and genomics) for personalized medicine.
