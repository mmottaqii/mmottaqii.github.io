PhD Candidate in Biochemistry at CUNY | Computational Biologist

🌐 Exploring the Frontier of Precision Medicine and Biomarker Discovery

🧬 I am a dedicated researcher passionate about leveraging multi-omics data and advanced machine learning techniques to unravel complex biological processes and improve disease diagnostics and treatments. My work predominantly focuses on Alzheimer's disease, where I employ integrative omics analyses to identify novel biomarkers and understand disease mechanisms.

📊 Currently, I am engaged in several exciting projects:

Integrative Multi-Omics for Alzheimer's Disease: Developing predictive models to identify AD biomarkers by integrating genomic, transcriptomic, and other omics data.

Personalized Biomedical Knowledge Graphs for Drug Repurposing: Utilizing large language models to innovate drug repurposing strategies, enhancing targeted therapeutic interventions.

Precision Medicine Initiatives: Harnessing machine learning to dissect and interpret complex datasets, aiming to translate these insights into clinical applications.


👥 Open to collaborations that push the boundaries of bioinformatics and personalized medicine. I am particularly interested in projects that utilize AI to address pressing challenges in healthcare.

📝 My research has been published in several academic journals and presented at international conferences, contributing to the scientific community’s understanding of disease pathology and treatment potential.
